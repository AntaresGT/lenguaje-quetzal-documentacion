## üéØ Mission
Build a fully featured Spanish programming language for general-purpose development, not just for teaching.

## üöÄ Short-term vision
Turn Quetzal Language into a tool capable of running on a server to handle requests and execute code in real time, making it easier to develop web applications and backend services.

## üå± Motivation
Programming has no borders, but it can have roots. Quetzal aims to provide the Spanish-speaking community with a modern, safe, efficient language written entirely in Spanish, allowing developers to create applications more intuitively and naturally. It also makes it easier to teach programming concepts to those whose native language is Spanish.

## üè≠ Quetzal is production-ready
Do not think of Quetzal as just a language to learn programming. It is a powerful tool that experienced developers can use to build robust and efficient applications. Currently at version 0.0.1, Quetzal already includes a working interpreter and a Visual Studio Code extension that enhances the development experience.
