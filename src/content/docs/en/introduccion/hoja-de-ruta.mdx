## Mission
Create a programming language in Spanish that is fully functional for general purpose use, not just for teaching.

## Short-term Vision
For Quetzal Language to become a tool capable of running on a server to respond to requests and execute code in real-time, facilitating the development of web applications and backend services.

## Motivation
Programming has no borders, but it can have roots. Quetzal aims to provide the Spanish-speaking community with a modern, secure, efficient language entirely in Spanish, allowing Spanish-speaking developers to create applications more intuitively and naturally. It also facilitates teaching programming concepts to those who have Spanish as their native language.

## Quetzal is for Production
Don't see Quetzal as a programming language only for learning to program, but as a powerful tool that can be used by experienced developers to create robust and efficient applications. Currently in version 0.0.2, Quetzal already has a functional interpreter and a Visual Studio Code extension that improves the development experience.
