title: Welcome to Quetzal Language
description: General introduction to Quetzal Language v0.0.12, its main goals and characteristics.

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

**Quetzal Language** is a modern interpreted programming language, designed with fully Spanish syntax to make programming more accessible to the Spanish-speaking community.

## What is Quetzal Language?

Quetzal is a runtime-interpreted language implemented in **Rust** to guarantee high performance and safety. Its design focuses on:

- **Spanish syntax**: Every keyword is written in Spanish
- **Strong typing**: Prevents common errors at analysis time
- **Native JSON support**: Direct interoperability with JSON structures
- **Optimized performance**: Implemented in Rust for maximum efficiency

## Project goals

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Accessible for Spanish speakers" icon="document">
    All keywords use Spanish: `si`, `sino`, `lista`, `consola`, `retornar`, among others. This decision reduces the learning curve for people who think and work in Spanish.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Instant productivity" icon="rocket">
    The interpreter offers lists, JSON, and objects oriented toward building real-world applications. The built-in methods let you manipulate data without extra dependencies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Robustness" icon="seti:csv">
    Lexical and syntactic analysis detects errors early. Messages include suggestions and highlight the line with the issue so you can debug quickly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extensibility" icon="sourcehut">
    Modules let you organize code in separate files and share definitions via `exportar` and `importar`. This version also includes native modules such as `quetzal/matemática`.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Why Quetzal?

### **Language accessibility**
Quetzal removes the language barrier in programming, enabling Spanish-speaking developers to work with familiar concepts in their native tongue.

## What is included in version v0.0.2

- Primitive types (`entero`, `número`, `texto`, `log`, `vacio`), typed and untyped lists, and `jsn` values with advanced access methods.
- Objects with `privado` and `publico` blocks, constructors, free attributes, and support for static members.
- Imports and exports between `.qz` files, symbol aliases, and permissions controlled through `quetzal.json` to access the file system.
- Exception handling with `intentar`, `capturar`, `finalmente`, and explicit error throwing with `lanzar`.
- Console methods for success, warning, error, info, and prompts for input or passwords.

## First look at the language

```qz
importar {
    Matemática
} desde "quetzal/matemática"

objeto Usuario {
    privado:
        texto nombre
        entero edad
    publico:
        Usuario(texto nombre, entero edad) {
            ambiente.nombre = nombre
            ambiente.edad = edad
        }

        texto saludo() {
            retornar t"Hola, {ambiente.nombre}. Tienes {ambiente.edad} años."
        }
}

Usuario persona = nuevo Usuario("María", 29)
número suma = Matemática.sumar(7, 3)

consola.mostrar_exito(persona.saludo())
consola.mostrar(t"Resultado de 7 + 3: {suma}")
```

### **Spanish-speaking community**
Designed specifically to foster the growth of programming in the Spanish-speaking community.

## Project philosophy

> *"Programming should not require leaving your native language behind. Quetzal brings modern programming to Spanish while preserving the power and elegance of contemporary languages."*

See Quetzal not only as a learning language, but also as a powerful tool to build modern and efficient applications—all in Spanish.

## Made in Guatemala

The name “Quetzal” pays homage to Guatemala’s national bird, symbolizing freedom and beauty.
The language was created by a very small team of Guatemalan developers passionate about borderless technology.
