## Step-by-Step Installation

<Steps>

1. **Download the executable**

   Go to the GitHub releases page and download the latest version:
    - [Quetzal Language Releases](https://github.com/AntaresGT/lenguaje-quetzal/releases)
    - Look for the file named `quetzal.exe` in the **Assets** section of the latest release.

2. **Create installation directory**

   Create a folder for Quetzal on your system. We recommend:

   ```
   C:\quetzal\
   ```

   Move the downloaded `quetzal.exe` file to this folder.

3. **Configure environment variables**

   To run Quetzal from any location:

   - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl` and press Enter
   - Go to the **"Advanced"** tab
   - Click on **"Environment Variables"**
   - In **"System variables"**, find the `Path` variable and click **"Edit"**
   - Click **"New"** and add the path: `C:\quetzal`
   - Click **"OK"** on all windows

4. **Verify the installation**

   Open a new **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** window and run:

   ```cmd
   quetzal --version
   ```

   You should see something like:
   ```
   Lenguaje Quetzal v0.0.2
   ```

</Steps>

## Basic Usage

### Run a Quetzal file

```cmd
quetzal my_program.qz
```

### View help

```cmd
quetzal --ayuda
```

## Quick Verification

Create a file named `test.qz` with the following content:

```qz
// Test file to verify installation
consola.mostrar_exito("Quetzal Language installed successfully!")

entero edad = 25
texto nombre = "Maria"

consola.mostrar("Hola " + nombre + ", tienes " + edad.texto() + " anos")

si (edad >= 18) {
    consola.mostrar("Eres mayor de edad")
} sino {
    consola.mostrar("Eres menor de edad")
}
```

Run the file:

```cmd
quetzal test.qz
```

If you see the correct output, the installation was successful!

## Troubleshooting
