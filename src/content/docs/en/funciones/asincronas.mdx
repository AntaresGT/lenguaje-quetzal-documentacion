title: Asynchronous Functions
description: Current status of asynchronous support in Quetzal Language.
---

The Quetzal Language grammar includes the reserved words `asincrono` and `esperar` to prepare for asynchronous function support. However, in version v0.0.2 these features are not yet fully implemented in the interpreter.

## Reserved Syntax

```qz
asincrono texto obtener_datos() {
    // Pending implementation
}

texto resultado = esperar obtener_datos()
```

The above code cannot currently be executed; the interpreter will show an error indicating the functionality is not available.

## Roadmap

- Functions marked with `asincrono` will be able to execute operations that return promises or deferred tasks.
- `esperar` will allow pausing the current function until the asynchronous task finishes.
- The system will respect the same type rules and error handling as synchronous functions.

## Temporary Recommendations

- Implement I/O-dependent operations as synchronous functions and use native modules (e.g., `quetzal/matematica`) while asynchronous support is completed.
- Follow roadmap updates to know the availability of this feature.

When the functionality is released, this section will include practical examples and recommended patterns.
