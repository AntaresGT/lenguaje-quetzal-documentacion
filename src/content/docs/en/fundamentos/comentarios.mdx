description: Ways to document code in Quetzal Language and usage recommendations.
---

Quetzal Language supports two comment styles.

## Single-Line Comments

Start with `//` and extend to the end of the line.

```qz
// Start the program
consola.mostrar("Hola")
```

## Multi-Line Comments

Delimited by `/*` and `*/`. Content can span multiple lines.

```qz
/*
 User module documentation.
 Includes constructors and helper functions.
*/
objeto Usuario { ... }
```

### Nested Comments

Nested comments are not supported. Avoid patterns like `/* ... /* ... */ ... */` because the interpreter considers them a syntax error.

## Best Practices

- Describe the purpose of complex blocks instead of repeating the code.
- Keep comments synchronized with the actual program behavior.
- In objects and modules, document the intent of `privado` and `publico` members to facilitate maintenance.
- Use comments to indicate permission requirements defined in `quetzal.json` when your module depends on the file system.

Comments are removed during interpretation and do not affect program performance.
